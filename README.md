# YourReactionTime

This is a reaction time tester website with customizable attributes.

Currently, you can change the **color** of screens in the reaction area and the rectangular **size** of the reaction area. <br>
You can also track your average reaction time over 3-5 trials.

- Different colors may affect reaction time due to color sensitivty or being more noticeable
- Different sizes may affect reaction time for peripheral vision reflex vs. trained reflex.

I'm also into FPS games in which reaction time is key for good performance, so I thought it'd be cool to make my own reaction time tester website.
